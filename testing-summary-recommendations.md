Automated Testing Implementation for Conniption
Summary of Testing Strategy
I've created a comprehensive automated testing strategy for your Conniption image board application. The testing approach includes:

Unit Testing for both frontend and backend components
Integration Testing for API routes, React components, and user flows
End-to-End Testing with Cypress for critical user journeys
Load Testing with k6 to ensure performance under high traffic
CI/CD Pipeline using GitHub Actions for continuous testing and deployment
Implemented Test Solutions
Frontend Testing
Jest configuration optimized for React 19
React Testing Library setup for component testing
Component tests for key components like LandingPage and CreateThreadPage
Mock implementations for API calls, image uploads, and router functionality
Test utilities for common testing patterns
Backend Testing
Jest configuration for the Express backend
Model tests using pg-mem for in-memory PostgreSQL testing
Route tests using Supertest to test API endpoints
Middleware tests for error handling and authorization
Mock implementations for R2 storage and other external services
E2E Testing
Cypress setup for end-to-end testing
Test scenarios covering critical user flows
Intercept patterns for mocking API responses
Load Testing
k6 script for simulating user load
Metrics collection for response times, error rates, and throughput
Test stages for normal, high, and spike load scenarios
DevOps
Docker and Docker Compose configurations for local development and testing
CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated testing
Test reporting with code coverage tracking
Best Practices Implemented
Test Isolation: Each test is isolated and doesn't depend on other tests
Mocking External Dependencies: External services like R2 and PostgreSQL are mocked for reliable testing
Comprehensive Coverage: Tests cover components, routes, models, and middleware
Test Data Management: Utilities for creating test data and cleaning up after tests
Continuous Integration: Tests run automatically on each push and pull request
Performance Testing: Load tests ensure the application performs well under stress
Running Tests Locally
Frontend Tests
bash

# Navigate to frontend directory

cd frontend

# Run all tests

npm test

# Run tests with coverage

npm run test:coverage

# Run Cypress E2E tests

npm run cy:open # Interactive mode
npm run test:e2e # Headless mode
Backend Tests
bash

# Navigate to backend directory

cd backend

# Run all tests

npm test

# Run tests with coverage

npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode

npm run test:watch
Using Docker
bash

# Start all services with Docker Compose

docker-compose up

# Run frontend tests in Docker

docker-compose exec frontend npm test

# Run backend tests in Docker

docker-compose exec backend npm test
Recommendations for Future Enhancements
Expand Test Coverage: Add more tests for edge cases and error scenarios
Implement Contract Testing: Use tools like Pact.js to test the contract between frontend and backend
Visual Regression Testing: Add visual regression tests for the UI using tools like Percy
Security Testing: Integrate security testing tools like OWASP ZAP into the CI pipeline
Accessibility Testing: Add accessibility tests using tools like axe-core
Monitoring: Implement monitoring and alerting for production environment
Test Database Migrations: Add tests for database migrations to ensure smooth upgrades
Test Data Generation: Create more comprehensive test data generators
Conclusion
This automated testing implementation provides a solid foundation for ensuring the quality of the Conniption application. The tests cover all critical components and user flows, and the CI/CD pipeline ensures that tests run automatically with each code change. By following the included test plan and expanding on it as the application evolves, you can maintain high quality and reliability for your users.
